# Discord-SMT-bot
This bot is currently designed around SMT 4, as this game is current the one with the most demons in the franchise. The main purpose of the bot is to bring together 
useful information about the game into one place, as well as have features for fans of the franchise

Planned Features/ potential ideas:

Summon Demons in your server - Currently implemented, plan to add a database so each member of a server can keep track of their demons, also will implement 
also will implement a cooldown on the command so each user can only summon every so often.

Get info about demons in the game - See things such as the level, weaknesses/resistances, etc in the server. Implemented, plan to add things like base stats, starting skills, etc.

Skill List - get info about all of the different skills in SMT IV (and other MegaTen games once more are implemented)

Fusion Guide - list all of the possible fusion combinations to make each demon in SMT IV

Apps List - list and give infos about the apps in SMT IV

Dungeon Maps/help - provide images of maps and some tips/guidance for dungeons in the game

Boss help - get the boss's stats, weaknesses, and some tips to help defeat them

Side Quests - provide a list of all sidequests by area, and then give info on how to find/complete each quest.

Video Player - implement functionality of discord music/video bot to play tutorials, guides, and other videos from the MegaTen community

News - give a command where users can see latest news, like release dates, annoucements, etc. regarding the series. (Learn webscraping to accomplish this?)

Challenge run - Provide a random challenge to make a run of the game more exciting/difficult

Price list - (again, learn webscraping?) Provide up to date prices for purchasing physical copies of games in the series.

Expand to include help/info/commands for other SMT games and others in the larger MegaTen series, like Persona and Devil Survivor.
